## Install Flask
Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask:

<p><code> pip install Flask </code></p>
Flask is now installed. Check out the Quickstart or go to the Documentation Overview.

## Living on the edge
If you want to work with the latest Flask code before itâ€™s released, install or update the code from the master branch:

pip install -U https://github.com/pallets/flask/archive/master.tar.gz
